## üí° Why?

In the last few year we've adopted and used a good number of ui-libraries, even though these libraries generally provide 
a strong ally in developing user interfaces, sometimes the struggle to customise their components' style or behaviour 
may be quite an effort, especially when customising few line of CSS costs the introduction of new technologies, languages 
or compilers. <br />
Not to mention the struggle with the hell, or the tendency of some libraries to export stateful components or the 
matter of sizes and spaces completely spoiled between components by the customisations.<br />
How to reduce the customising fatigue then? <br />
Given the over-explored sea of the ui-libraries, was the idea of building another one a solution already?<br />
Probably not, but thinking of a concrete, driven-by-props API for customising the components' behaviour whilst sticking 
to the old good CSS for customising their style was, in my humble opinion, quite close to an answer.<br />
That's why we created `beautiful-ui`, having in mind the intent to provide a lightweight yet easy-to-customise controlled 
components library.

### üéì Principles

- **Driven by grace**: instead of customising the padding/margin/color/whatever of a single component, 
customise the value of padding/margin/color/whatever trough a [configuration file](./docs/configuring.md), the library 
will then generate a tailored style keeping grace between components.
- **Render behaviour**: the majority of the exported components accept a `renderer` prop to possibly customise 
their behaviour
- **Controlled components**: components should be [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), that's it.
- **Lightweights**: import nothing but lightweight javascript components.
